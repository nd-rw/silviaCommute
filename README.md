display best route to work and home

## stuff im using
- using parts of [WazeRouteCalculator](https://github.com/kovacsbalu/WazeRouteCalculator) to get ETAs from waze
- python for code
- likely will run on raspberry pi that will need internet
  - VF display for period-correctness long-term but simplest display possible short term
  - need to power from car and run script on pi as soon as it boots
  - 2 buttons, one for "ETA and best route HOME" other for "ETA and best route to WORK"
